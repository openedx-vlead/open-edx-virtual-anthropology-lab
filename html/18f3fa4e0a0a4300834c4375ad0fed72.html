<p>Experimental studies consist of controlled experiments used to replicate prehistoric ceramic manufacturing processes. It includes the reconstruction of the size and shape of the pottery, which is the experiment undertaken here.</p>

<p class="content">In real laboratories rim sherds are taken as the only appropriate pieces for reconstructing the size. The diameter of the rim is ascertained by setting the rim in concentric circles of different sizes. The circle in which the rim sits exactly, that is without exposing the edges of the circumference of the circle at the two ends of the rim that is considered the right size. The diameter determines the width of the mouth of the pot. The profile of the rim is drawn on the left edge of the diameter and the same is drawn in reverse order on the right edge. In VAL this is done virtually by using images of the rim sherds of different sizes.</p>

<p class="content">In the simulation page, under each pottery page four images have been provided. Of these only one is the image of a rim sherd which is the piece from the mouth of the pot. This image is to be dragged and the rim is to be adjusted in the correct concentric circle provided on the right hand side of the page.Once the rim is adjusted, the diameter of the circle which is already calculated and displayed in the page should be filled in the text box provided. In the next page drag the profile image to the left hand edge of the diameter and fit it with the topmost point of the image touching the diameter and the sides touching the straight line already drawn on the left edge of the diameter. For complete reconstruction, drag the appropriate profile line amongst the four lines provided in the box in the left and set the profile line in the opposite or right hand edge of the diameter. This line is the reverse side view of the profile image. With this we get the exact size and shape of the mouth of the pot under reconstruction. After this follow the step by step procedure available in the page for completing the experiment.</p>

<p class="content">Procedure to be followed:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Pick up the correct rim sherd &amp; obtain its diameter.</li>
<li>Type the diameter in the given box.</li>
<li>Check whether correct.</li>
<li>Click next.</li>
<li>Drag and set the profile object at left side of top line, choose reverse line drawing and do same at right side.</li>
