<p>There are four astronomical directions in palm, namely proximal, distal, radical and ulnar.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The clefts between the digits are called interdigital intervals. They are numbered 1,2,3,4, in the radio ulnar sequence . As shown in the figure1 , there are six elevations on the palmer surface, of which four are lying proximal to interdigital&nbsp; intervals. They are called interdigital pads and numbered I, II,III, IV in relation to the corresponding interdigital intervals. On the base of interdigital pads I there is large prominence occupying a major portion of the proximo-raidal quadrant of the palm. This is the thenar eminence. Lying on the ulnar direction there is an elongated eminence which is called the hypothenar eminence.</p>
<p>Four digital triadii are located on the bases of digits 2,3,4, and 5 and are designated as a,b,c,d in the radio &ndash; ulnar sequence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a fifth triradius,which&nbsp; may be more than one in number , towards the proximal margin of the palm. This triradius is called axial triradius and designated by the letter t. The proximal radiant of the digital triradius is called a palmer main line when traces fully. Corresponding to the digital triadii a, b, c, d, these main lined are called A, B, C, D respectively.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The periphery of palm is divided into a series of 14 intervals and points .The area covered by the thenar eminence on the radial side if the axial triradius is position 1. The axial triradius is a point and designated position 2. Likewise all the digital triradii are points and numbered positions 6,8,10, 12 corresponding to tridii d,c,b and a respectively. The area covering from position 2 to the midpoint on the ulnar border around the proximal margin of the hypothenar eminence is position 3.</p>
<p>The midpoint in the ulnar border is position 4. From position 4 to the triradial point 6 is position 5, which is divided into the two equal halves, the proximal half is position 5&rsquo; and the distal half is 5&rdquo;. The interdigital areas are numbered as positions 7, 9, 11, 13 in the ulnar sequence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When completely traced, the main lines constitute a skeleton. The terminating position of 4 main lines constitutes the palmar main line formula which is recorded in the order D, C, B, A. To illustrator this point, in Figure2 .&nbsp; for example , the palmer main line formula is 11,9,7,4.</p>
